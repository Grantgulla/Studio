        <p><b>WHAT IS IT?</b><br>Workwear/Abiti da Lavoro is an exhibition of experimental garments—“work clothes” made for imaginary professions—dedicated to revolutionary Italian fashion designer Elio Fiorucci (1935-2015)—and curated by Alessandro Guerriero.

Produced by Fondazione La Triennale di Milano in collaboration with Parsons School of Design, the exhibition features garments by 39 international designers, including revolutionary Italian fashion designer Elio Fiorucci, who imagine “workwear” for hypothetical professions—a whimsical critique on the fashionization of work clothes.

The exhibition is the brainchild of Guerriero, who originally created the exhibition to support Arkadia Onlus, an educational organization that works with young people with disabilities. Twelve designers in the exhibition provided sketches of imaginary work clothes, which were then sewed by the young people of Arkadia Onlus.

The designers in the exhibition include Nathalie Du Pasquier, Elio Fiorucci, Mella Jaarsma, Guda Koster, Toshiyuki Kita, Coop Himmelb(l)au, Issey Miyake, Angela Missoni, Faye Toogood, Vivienne Westwood, Erwin Wurm, and Parsons faculty members, Otto von Busch and Allan Wexler, among others.

The New York edition of Workwear/Abiti da Lavoro was designed by Manuel Miranda Practice and created with the support of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and The Italian Cultural Institute in New York. Curatorial support was provided by Associazione Tam Tam.</p>
